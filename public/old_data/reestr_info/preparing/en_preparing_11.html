    most modern technologies are used, the animal feeding program is fully automated. The livestock is represented by
    black and white Holsteins, which were imported from Denmark in 2017. The farm is now a breeding reproducer; it is

    hectares. The main varieties grown: Gala, Golden, Red Delicious. All seedlings were imported from Serbia and Italy.

    modern fruit storage facility was built to store apples; it is designed to store 6 thousand tons of fruit. There are
    a total of 24 refrigeration chambers. The control of refrigerators is fully automated; for this purpose, a machine
    room is equipped above the chambers, which is responsible for the operation of the entire complex. Also installed in
