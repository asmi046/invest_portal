    <li>Project name: Kursk NPP radioactive waste processing complex</li>
    <li>Project content: processing and storage of radioactive waste. Ensuring the safe operation of nuclear power
        plants throughout the entire design period is largely determined by solving the problem of radioactive waste
        management.</li>

    <li>Project implementation period: 2016 -2024.</li>
    <li>Financing, billion rubles: 30623.28 billion rubles</li>
    <li>Current status of the project: installation of equipment for the NZK sealing line is underway in the production
        building of KhP RAO. At the moment, construction and installation work on the CITFZ is being completed. The
        installation of ventilation equipment in the LRW production facility is nearing completion.</li>

<blockquote>“Safety is the main priority of nuclear energy. And nuclear, and radiation, and fire, and industrial, and
    environmental and others, but the general property of safety is one thing - this is the state of protection of
    people and the environment from harmful and dangerous production factors,” noted Andrey Shchigolev, chief engineer
    of the Kursk NPP. – KP RAO is one of the most important solutions to the issue of nuclear power plant safety. Our
    goal is to complete the energy cycle implemented at the Kursk station by processing, temporary storage and disposal
    of waste. Therefore, the construction and operation of a new facility is a environmentally friendly solution for
    Kurchatov and the Kursk region.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Development of the production infrastructure of Kursk NPP is in the field of close attention of the
    regional administration. The regional administration is interested in stable, reliable and safe operation of one of
    the largest enterprises. The electric power industry is a basic branch of the economy, one of the largest donors of
    budgets of all levels. Kursk NPP has always been a guarantor of social responsibility in the region, - noted Igor
    Korpunkov, the Head of Kurchatov city. - Time goes on, new, more advanced technologies appear. They will be used at
    the new complex of Kursk NPP. Thanks to the complex, the existing waste will be brought into a compact and
    non-extractable state and thus prepared for transfer to the National Operator. The population of the region and the
    authorities welcome this. We pay special attention to the fact that the waste generated during the operation of
    Kursk NPP only will be processed here".</blockquote>
