    <li>Project content: Zinkum LLC plans to build a plant for the production of zinc oxide. The project is environmentally significant, as it allows for the safe disposal of ESPC dust.
    Starting from the second half of 2025, the plant will annually process over 100 thousand tons of dust from gas cleaners of electric steelmaking plants from Russia and other countries of the Eurasian Economic Union.</li>
    <li>Financing, billion rubles: 10,800 billion rubles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The plant will become an example of waste-free production and green metallurgy.
    The enterprise will be able to process more than 100 thousand tons of secondary resources and obtain from them zinc oxide and iron-containing clinker, which are in demand in non-ferrous and ferrous metallurgy.
    Previously, the Zinkum plant was included in the list of pilot projects of the sectoral government program aimed at the use of secondary raw materials from waste in industrial production.
    The program is part of the federal project "Closed-loop Economics".
    The Federal Center pays special attention to the "Third Pole".
    Its main goal is to develop the manufacturing sectors of the economy through the creation of modern industrial production complexes capable of producing high–tech products of deep industrial processing in order to meet the needs of the Russian economy and stimulate exports.
    This will give the region new jobs and an increase in financial revenues to the budget.
    On August 31, 2023, in the presence of the Governor of the Kursk Region Roman Starovoit, a trilateral agreement on the implementation of industrial and production activities was signed between the Ministry of Economic Development of the Kursk Region, Kursk Region Development Corporation JSC and Zinkum LLC, as a result of which Zinkum LLC received the status of a resident of the Third Pole Special Economic Zone.
    The total area of the SEZ leaves more than 237 hectares. On August 31, 2023, the Third Pole SEZ was replenished with two new residents of LLC Zinkum and LLC Advanced Technologies – Mashinostroitel.</p>
    Previously, three resident (anchor) companies were registered: Mikhailovsky GBZH LLC, Vagonmash Group and Quartz Group.</p>
