    <p>Mansurovo is the largest agricultural company in the region. About 600 people work here. People receive decent wages â€“ an average of 40-60 thousand rubles.
    Transportation and accommodation are provided for employees. I would especially like to note the social orientation of the company: they build roads, conduct water, built and maintain a temple, help districts in solving emerging problems.
    They also contain the oldest enterprise in the Kursk region, Alexandrovsky Stud Farm No. 12, where about 120 breeding heads of Russian trotting horses are located.</p>
