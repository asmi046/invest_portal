    <li>Project name: construction of Kursk NPP-2 (replacement station for Kursk NPP). Power units No. 1 and No. 2</li>
    <li>Project content: construction of a replacement station for Kursk NPP-2, equipped with a new type of reactor
        plant - VVER-TOI (standard water-water energy reactor, optimized, computerized), with a capacity of 1255 MW.

    <li>Project implementation period: 2013 -2027.</li>
    <li>Financing, billion rubles: 30.623 billion rubles</li>
    <li>Current status of the project: in the turbine building of power unit No. 2 of Kursk NPP-2, three overhead
        electric double-girder support cranes with a lifting capacity of 15, 30 and 290 tons have been installed and put
        into operation. At the construction site of Kursk NPP-2, concreting of the dome of the outer containment shell
        of power unit No. 1 has been completed.

<p><strong>For information</strong></p>
<p>The construction of Kursk NPP-2 is provided for in the document approved in November 2013 by the Government of the
    Russian Federation - “Scheme of territorial planning of the Russian Federation in the field of energy”, which
    determines the time frame for the construction of power units No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and Kursk NPP-2.</p>
<p>The purpose of the construction of Kursk NPP-2 is to replace power units No. 1 and No. 2 of Kursk NPP after the end
    of their service life.</p>
<p>The main socio-economic effect is to reduce the risk of energy shortages in the region and the supply of electricity
    to the unified energy system of the Center.</p>
<p>It is planned to implement a project for new generation VVER-TOI power units with increased safety and improved
    technical and economic characteristics.</p>
<p>The Kursk NPP-2 project meets both the requirements of the Russian Federation and all modern international
    requirements in the field of nuclear energy safety. It uses four active channels of safety systems (duplicating each
    other), a melt localization device, a passive heat removal system from under the reactor shell, and a passive heat
    removal system from steam generators.</p>
<p>The total installed capacity of the two nuclear power plant units is ~ 2510 MW. The thermal power of the reactor is
    3312 MW.</p>
