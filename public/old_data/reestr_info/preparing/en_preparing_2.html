<h2>Large-scale construction of DKK-2 is underway on the northeastern side of the central quarry.</h2>
<p>Productivity is 35 million tons of ore per year, length is 2.5 kilometers, maximum inclination angle is 13 degrees -
    these are the characteristics of the second stage of the crushing and conveyor complex.</p>
<p>The outlines of the main objects are already clearly visible: a coarse crusher with a record productivity of 7200
    tons per hour, a stacker, and four conveyors of different types.</p>
<p>The work involves the implementation of complex construction and installation processes, which are determined by the
    installation of spans over the railway tracks,” Evgeniy Manukhin, project manager of the MGOK DCC under
    construction, talks about the intricacies of the complex’s construction. — One of these trusses was mounted
    immediately above six railway tracks. Its weight was 95 tons, length - 54 meters</p>
<p>The installation of basic process equipment has already begun in some areas. It is supplied by the leading Russian
    manufacturer of mining equipment, a time-tested partner of Metalloinvest - Uralmashzavod. The main construction work
    is carried out by the general contractor for the facility - the Rudstroy company. About 140 professional builders
    work on the site every day.</p>
<p>DKK-2 is an important investment project of the Metalloinvest company, which is aimed at developing production
    capacities and increasing the efficiency of the mining and transport complex of the Mikhailovsky GOK.</p>
