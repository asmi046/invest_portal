    <li>Project content: Mikhailovsky HBI LLC plans to implement a project for the construction of a complex of
        industrial facilities for the production of hot briquetted iron in the amount of 2.08 million tons per year and
        its further sale to interested consumers.</li>
    <li>Project implementation period: 2020 -2024.</li>
    <li>Financing, billion rubles: 47,567 billion rubles</li>
    <li>Current status of the project: planned for implementation</li>
    <li>Investor: Mikhailovsky HBI LLC</li>

<p><strong>For reference:</strong></p>
<p>The USM group of Alisher Usmanov and its controlled Metalloinvest will build a plant for the production of hot
    briquetted iron (HBI) in the Kursk region worth more than 40 billion rubles (excluding VAT).</p>
<p>The operator of the project, which will be implemented using project financing, will be Mikhailovsky HBI LLC (MGBZh,
    55% owned by USM, 45% owned by Metalloinvest's Mikhailovsky GOK).</p>
<p>The plant's design capacity will be more than 2 million tons per year, making it one of the largest in the world for
    the production of this type of iron ore raw material.</p>
<p>The start of production is scheduled for the first half of 2024. Raw materials for the new enterprise will be
    supplied by Mikhailovsky GOK.</p>
<p>“The new metallization plant is designed on the principles of carbon-free metallurgy - with the prospect of a
    complete transition to the use of “green” hydrogen as a reducing agent. This project creates the basis for the
    development of “green” metallurgy and the transition of the global industry to environmentally friendly steel
    production technologies,” said Nazim Efendiev, CEO of Metalloinvest, whose words are quoted in the message.</p>
<p>The plant will produce high-quality HBI using the natural gas-based direct reduction process Midrex NG, the world's
    greenest iron production technology. Compared to blast furnace iron smelting, Midrex NG has a 50% lower carbon
    footprint. In the future, replacing natural gas with “green” hydrogen will allow us to achieve even greater
    reductions in emissions, the press release notes.</p>
