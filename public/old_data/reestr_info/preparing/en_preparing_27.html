    <p>JSC Elektroagregat is one of the leading enterprises of the Kursk region, the largest manufacturer of autonomous power supplies in the Russian Federation used in the departments of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, Rosgvardiya, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia, JSC Russian Railways, Rosrezerv, PJSC Rostelecom, oil and gas gas production industries, geophysics and geological exploration, forestry and mining, agriculture, healthcare, housing and communal services and other economic activities.
    Hundreds of business partners are associated with the company throughout Russia and abroad.
    JSC "Electroagregat" has licenses for the development, production, repair and produces the following certified products:
    • stationary and mobile power plants with a capacity from 1 to 2,500 kW with a single capacity and varying degrees of automation;
    • two-unit products of increased mobility based on the chassis of Ural, Kamaz and other special vehicles;
    • gas-piston power plants and mini-CHP plants based on them;
    • APEA-60 units designed to power on-board electrical equipment of aircraft;
    • hybrid diesel-electric stations with an accumulating system. This power plant is a mobile integrated energy source, which includes: a diesel generator set, solar panels, a wind turbine, a hydropower plant, a storage system based on lithium-ion batteries and an inverter for charging storage cells and discharge processes on an alternating current load;
    • synchronous generators of the GS-XXX-B-KM series (at 1500 rpm) and GS2 (at 3000 rpm) with a capacity from 1 kW to 2000 kW, including ship versions with certificates of river (RRR) and marine (RMRS) registers;
    • synchronous generators with an increased current frequency of 400 Hz and power from 16 kW to 120 kW;
    • synchronous generators with voltage of 6.3 and 10.5 kV and power from 500 kW to 2000 kW;
    • synchronous generators with a capacity of 16 and 30 kW of waterproof (splash-proof) design with a degree of protection IP44;
    • 400 and 800 Hz electric frequency converters with a capacity of 20, 30, 60 and 100 kW;
    • welding generators and stationary and mobile diesel welding units based on them;
    • trailers of various modifications, as well as casings, bodies and containers;
    • household vibration pumps.
    In recent years, the joint-stock company has carried out a lot of work on the development and launch into mass production of a large number of new products that were not previously produced in Russia.
    One of the latest developments of the plant was the emergency rescue vehicle ED30-AI based on the KAMAZ-6350 automobile chassis, which has a special van body, it houses a 30 kW diesel electric unit, a portable 4 kW power plant and a variety of various electric, hydro and pneumatic tools, as well as other equipment.
    Also, the design service of the plant has developed a hybrid diesel-electric power plant SGDEAS-30 with an accumulating system that combines the operation of the source on both traditional and renewable fuels. The use of this electric power supply system makes it possible to increase the engine life of a diesel generator set by more than 3 times, and also significantly reduce the consumption of fuels and lubricants (diesel fuel and oil).
    JSC Electroagregat has developed a diesel power plant E500PB with a capacity of 500 kW, which is designed to be used as a power source with three-phase current, voltage 400V and frequency 50Hz for any facilities and infrastructures of various consumers. This power plant has a modular system for building work on a single load, that is, several such stations can be connected to parallel operation at peak times. In addition, the product has two output panels, one with a rated power of 500 kW, and the second with a divided power of 5x100 kW.
    As part of the implementation of the import substitution program, the company has been working in recent years on the development and introduction into production of high-power generators from 1000 to 2000 kW, including high-voltage 6.3 and 10.5 kV generators, water-resistant generators, as well as marine generators, including those with outboard cooling.</p>
