<p>The territorial balance of the reserves of common minerals of the Kursk region as 01.01.2022 took into account 230 deposits and sections of the subsoil of local importance with the total reserves of sand and stones of construction, raw materials for expanded clay products (loam and clay light -melted), raw materials for bricks (clay, loop, merceli, chatter ) in the volume of 240.296 million m3, as well as the clay of refractory, chalk, peat – in the amount of 132.838 million tons, of which about 40%are operated.</p>
<p>In the territory of the Kursk region, the extraction of common minerals in local subsoil plots is formed by the private sector of the economy. In this direction, about 72 legal entities and individual entrepreneurs in 23 districts of the Kursk region operate in this direction.</p>
<p>Sands are the basis for the production of construction organizations of the Kursk region and one of the most popular and common types of non -metallic raw materials. To the group of the largest deposits and subsoil sites of local importance, the balance supplies of which on 01.01.2022 are more than 5 million m3, include: the new Buzets deposit in the Zheleznogorsk district, the Lipinsky deposit, the Anakhinskoye field in the Oktyabrsky district, and the subsoil section of the subsoil ” Glusitsky 1 ”in the Liga district, a section of the subsoil of local“ Zherebtsovo 2 ”in the Kursk district.</p>
<p>OPI – sand in 2021 was carried out by 36 subsoil users. The total amount of sand mining, taken into account by the state balance, amounted to 4026.00 thousand m3. Based on the results of the work on exploration and revaluation, the balance reserves of sand increased by 6475.51 thousand m3. The total increase in balance reserves was 2133.53 thousand m3.</p>
<p>Divine deposits of brick raw materials (clay, loam, Mergeli, chatter) are available in all areas of the region, which indicates practically unlimited prospects for increasing the raw material base of this type of raw materials. The extraction of raw materials for brick in 2021 was carried out by 5 subsoil users. The total amount of production of raw materials taken into account by the territorial balance was 63.28 thousand m3.</p>
<p>In the Kursk region as of 01.01.2022, the territorial balance of reserves of raw materials for expanded clay products took into account 1 deposit – Novoselovskoye field in the Oktyabrsky district. The following deposits and manifestations are of practical interest in the development of the raw material base of the city of Kursk and the region: Pozhdaevskoye (Shchigrovsky district), Bolsobobrovskoye and Ratmanovskoye (Zheleznogorsk district), Volobuevskoye (Kursk district), Manturovskoye (Manturovsky district), Oboyanskoye (Oboyansk district).</p>
<p>Based on the results of the work on the geological study of the subsoil, the balance reserves of the chalk increased by 1193.23 thousand tons. The total increase in balance reserves amounted to 862.41 thousand tons. In 2021, 2 subsoil users carried out. The total amount of mining, taken into account by the state balance, amounted to 88.12 thousand tons.</p>
<p>In terms of quality, chalk of most deposits is suitable for the production of small -magnesial, fast -drunk, highly expostermic air lime 1 grade of class A and V.</p>
<p>For agricultural needs in the field are explored and listed on the balance sheet. There are three deposits in the state reserve (Pogozheyoye, fishing lines, Semenovskoye), the reserves of which are evaluated as suitable for the production of limestone flour for lime (chemical reclamation) of acidic soils and for mineral top dressing of animals and birds.</p>
<p>In the Kursk region as of 01.01.2022, the territorial balance of mineral reserves of minerals took into account 1 deposit of refractory Glin “Bolshaya Karpovka” in the Soviet district of the Kursk region. The deposit is located in the Sovetsky district 4.5 km northeast of the Kshena railway station, 130 km from the city of Kursk. Clains of the deposits are suitable for the production of acid -resistant brick, ceramic facial bricks, ceramic tiles for internal cladding walls, facades, floors, for the production of ceramic sewer pipes.</p>
<p>As building stones, the population of the Kursk region for local needs traditionally uses sandstones, which, in the form of small deposits and deposits in a number of areas, lie in the sands and loams of Paleogene.</p>
<p>In the Kursk region as of 01.01.2022, 3 deposits of construction stones in Zheleznogorsk (Serenteninsky deposit of the Mikhailovsky deposit) and Rylsky (Durovo deposit and the manifestation of Nekrasovo) were taken into account by the territorial balance of mineral reserves. The prospects for identifying profitable construction stone deposits in the foundation breeds are extremely limited, since the crystalline foundation lies at a depth of 120-200 or more meters.</p>
