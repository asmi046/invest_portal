<p>
    The Government of the Kursk Region pays special attention to the development of one of the spheres of the region –
    PPP. Over the past 5 years, about 30 significant agreements have been concluded totaling more than 20 billion
    rubles.
</p>
<p>
    The most important participants participating in the PPP for the implementation of large regional projects are
    companies: LLC Movistan Regions of Kursk (renewal of transport infrastructure), LLC Perekol 47 (development of
    educational infrastructure), LLC Flagman-Kursk (development of communal and energy infrastructure ). This indicates
    a serious priority given by the Kursk Region by the development of this sphere, which directly affects the increase
    in the standard of living and well -being of regional residents. We use services daily in the field of transport,
    healthcare, education and other areas.
</p>
<p>
    The quality of infrastructure in one way or another affects our lives, therefore, the constant updating of old and
    the creation of new objects is the key to the successful development of the country
