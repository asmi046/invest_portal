<li>If the initiator does not meet the established requirements or the investment project has not been prepared in accordance with the form, a refusal to register the received application is sent, which complies with the requirements of anti-corruption legislation.</li>
<li>The next important stage is the examination of the investment project, the selection of a curator and the preparation of an action plan for project support for approval, depending on the nature of the issues being resolved, the project and the action plan for its support are submitted to a meeting of the Government Commission (actually the "project office").</li>
